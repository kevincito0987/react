In reactjs there is:
 1. Functional components.
 They are just a Javascript/ES6 function that returns us a React (JSX) element.
 Functions:
 1.Must return a React (JSX) element.
 2.Must begin with a capitalized word.
 3. You can lean on values ​​if necessary.
 For example:
 Greeting function (props) {
 return <h1> Hello, {props.name} !</h1>
      }
 2. Class components.
 They are ES6 (Modern Javascript) classes that return a JSX element.
 Functions:
 1.You must extend React.Component.
 2.Must have a render() method to return a JSX element.
 3.Can receive values ​​if necessary.
 For example:
 class Greeting extend React.Component {
        to loan(){
 return <h1> Hello, {this.props.name} !</h1>
        }
     }
Props are arguments that a React component can receive, and can only send from "parent to child"
State is a Javascript representation of a component's set of properties and their current values ​​<current values>.
Hook is a special function that allows us to work with states in functional components and other react aspects without writing a class component, which allows us to write much more <much more> concise and easy to understand code.
In reactjs and nextjs the html and css attributes are written like this:
 1.class is write how className.
 2. for is to write how htmlFor.
 And the css attributes are written like this in reactjs and nextjs:
 background-image is written as backgroundImage.
To save styles in something we can do:
 1.Save the styles in a constant so that:
     const styleDiv ={
 yellow color',
 backgroundColor: 'black'
     }
 And added like this:
 <div style={styleDiv}>Hello world! </div>
 2.Write the styles on the element or component so that:
     <div
 color= 'yellow'
     >
 Hello World.!
     </div>
To render our components in reactjs or nextjs we can do it like this:
 In the HTML file we add:
    <div id="root"></div>
 In reactjs we can add it like this:
   const element = <h1>
 Hello World.!
   </h1>
    ReactDOM.render(
        element,
        document.getElementById('root') );
To import ReactDOM in our js file we can do it like this:
 import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
In reactjs we can do it to add a variable in component like so:
 let adjective = "Interesting".
   <p>React is {adjective}</p>
To create a react app we use the command:
  npx create-react-app name_app.
